        <button type="button" class="collapsible" id="Intro">A short introduction</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>All sorts of Spanish learners (at all levels) often confess to not being sure about the official rules on
                when to use and when not to use the Spanish acento («<strong>´</strong>») in writing. Many will say that
                the issue doesn't really affect them as they have developed a good instinctive feel for identifying
                where to put it and where not to put it down on the page. And of course, if that's the case, then
                there's no problem! But some learners will admit to being a little unsure.</p>

            <p>If you're one such Spanish learner, this site is for you! We aim to help remove any uncertainty in your
                mind by explaining the rules simply and clearly and then giving you the opportunity to practice what
                you've learned.</p>

            <p>Of course, to apply these rules properly, you'll first need to know where to put the stress when saying a
                word aloud, but that's another part of the language learning task. We leave that up to you, though we
                recommend that whatever method you choose to learn your Spanish vocabulary you should repeatedly say new
                words out loud until you're comfortable you're pronouncing them correctly.</p>
        </div>

        <button type="button" class="collapsible" id="what-its-for">What's the acento there for anyway?</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>There are three purposes to the written acento.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It's first and main purpose is to indicate to a reader what syllable to put the stress on a word
                    when speaking it. The general rules of pronunciation of Spanish will usually tell you without the
                    need for an acento, but sometimes it won't; and in such cases you'll need to write your acento on
                    the page (Lessons 1 to 3).
                </li>
                <li>Another purpose is to tell certain words that are pronounced the same
                    (and are otherwise spelt the same) apart from one another. (Lesson 4)</li>
                <li>Finally, in cases where a word contains two or three vowels in succession, a written acento may be
                    needed
                    to
                    tell whether the vowels should be pronounced as a single syllable (i.e. as a dipthong or a
                    tripthong)
                    or broken up into several syllables. (Lesson 5)</li>
            </ul>

            Directly below this short introduction you'll find five boxes, each of which will take you to an explanation
            of one
            of five aspects of the relevant rule. If you click or tap on any of them, you be given the option of either
            opening a pop-up box
            containing a short reminder list of the main points of the rule or navigating to a detailed explanation.

            The site also contains a couple of quizzes for you to practice what you've learned here. There is a Quiz
            icon <i class="fa-solid fa-pencil"></i> at the top right-hand-side of the site, which you can click to
            choose which of the quizzes you want to
            do. You
            can choose between a quick test on the grammatical rules themselves and a longer battery of questions to
            check how well you
            can apply the rules.

        <button type="button" class="collapsible" id="terminology">A quick word on terminology</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Many Spanish materials speak of the acento as a "tilde" (one of the two forms of tilde used in the
                Spanish
                language, the other one being the '~' found on top of the 'n' shape to form the letter 'ñ'). As most
                Spanish
                schoolchildren will spell out a word using the word 'acento' to indicate the written mark, we do the
                same to
                avoid confusion. It's worth remembering, though, that the acento is often referred to as the 'tilde' in
                serious articles
                on the
                Spanish language.</p>

            <p>Don't put a written accent on word whose stress is on their last syllable (the Real Academia de la
                Lengua Espanola call them "palabras agudas") unless they end with
                a consonant other than <em>n</em> or <em>s</em>.</p>

            <p>If they end with an <em>n</em> or an <em>s</em>, or with a vowel, you need to put the written accent
                on the stressed
                vowel.</p>

            <p>With words that have their stress on their second to last syllable (The Real Academia call these ones
                "palabras graves" or "palabras llanas"), the rule is the other way around:
                they <em>should</em> be given a written accent if they end with a consonant other than <em>n</em> or
                <em>s</em>. And
                if they end with an <em>n</em>, an <em>s</em> or a vowel, then you <em>shouldn't</em> mark the
                stress in writing.

            <p>There is, however, <em></em>an exception</em> you'll probably need to remember: with palabras llanas
                that end with <em>n</em> or <em>s</em>, if the <em>n</em> or <em>s</em> is
                preceded by a consonant, then you'll need to mark the stressed syllable with a written accent after
                all.</p>
            <p>This often affects words with a recent origin in a foreign language (or Latin).</p>

        </div>
        <div class="full-lesson">
            <p>Words with a stress on their third from last syllable (called "palabras esdrújulas" by the Real
                Academia) always have a written accent.</p>

            <h3>Examples:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    guapísimo
                </li>

            </ul>

            <p>Words with the stress before the third-last syllable (palabras sobreesdrújulas) also need their
                stressed
                syllable to be marked with a written accent.</p>

            <p>As always, though, (¿cómo no?) there is an exception. Luckily for us, it's pretty easy to remember:
                adverbs ending with <em>-mente</em> don't need a written accent unless the adjective that forms
                their root needs one. Effectively what the rule means is that you should add -mente as required by
                the applicable rules,
                leaving any written accent that was already on the root untouched.</p>

            <p>Question words need acentos</p>
            <p>Pronouns need acentos if they have homophones meaning something different.</p>
            <p>You need to remember the other words that have acentos to distinguish them from their homophones.</p>

            <div class="full-lesson"></div>
            <p>The first thing to say under this category is that dipthongs and tripthongs follow the same rules about
                when to add a written acento as any other vowels. But when there are two or three vowels written one
                after another, on which of them do you put the acento?</p>
            <p>Well the key to this problem lies in remembering that Spanish grammaticians split the vowels into strong
                ones (a, e and o) and weak ones (i and u).</p>
            <p>Dipthongs are always either a combination of two weak vowels or of one weak and one strong vowel. Two
                strong vowels written together are always pronounced as two separate syllables (sea).</p>
            <p>Tripthongs are always a combination of weak-strong-weak vowels. Any other combination of three vowels
                together will automatically be spoken using at least two syllables.</p>
            <p>So (brace yourself!), the rules on where to put your acento, if one is needed, are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>in dipthongs with two weak vowels, put the acento on the second of them (veintiún)</li>
                <li>in dipthongs with one weak and one strong vowel, put the acento on the strong one
                    (com-<strong>ió</strong>)</li>
                <li>in tripthongs, put the acento on the strong vowel, which will always be in the middle
                    (com-<strong>iáis</strong>)</li>
                <li>if you place an acento anywhere else, it will <ol>
                        <li>break the combination into two syllables</li>
                        <li>put the word's stress on the syllable you've marked with the acento
                            (sa-<strong>lí</strong>-ais)</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>
